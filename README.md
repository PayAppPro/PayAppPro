# PayAppPro

We build tools and open reference materials for **AIA-style construction billing**, with a focus on **G702 / G703 pay applications**, Schedule of Values (SOV), retainage, and progress billing workflows.

Our goal is to make construction billing clearer, more accurate, and easier to manage — both for contractors submitting pay applications and for developers building construction software.

## Open Reference Work

We maintain an open, educational repository that documents how AIA-style pay applications are commonly structured and calculated:

🔹 **AIA Pay Application Toolkit**  
https://github.com/PayAppPro/aia-pay-application-toolkit

That repository includes:
- Plain-English documentation for G702 and G703
- Realistic CSV and JSON examples
- Pay application schemas
- Billing logic notes (retainage, stored materials, progress vs final billing)

These materials are provided for **educational and reference purposes** and are not licensed AIA forms.

## Philosophy

Construction billing problems are rarely about intent — they’re usually about:
- Inconsistent math
- Poor structure
- Manual processes
- Lack of visibility between detail and summary

We believe good tooling and clear data models solve most of these issues.
